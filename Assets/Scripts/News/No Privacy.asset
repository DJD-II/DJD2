  headline: No Privacy!
  text1: There are no more secrets, at least in principle. Modern surveillance equipment
    is so powerful that there is no place on Earth except possibly  the deep ocean
    trenches where you can hide. The planet is orbited by spy satellites operated
    by FOG and several private organizations,  able to at the very least photograph
    where you are (in visible light, infrared and radio), tell the color of your coat
    and keep track of where you are moving.  The resolution of the civilian satellites
    is good enough to track vehicles and lone individuals, and the military satellites
    in low earth orbit are even more powerful.  However, they need to be above the
    horizon to work, which means the powers operating them have to either blanket
    the planet like the satellite  phone constellations or accept occasional interruptions
    in coverage.
  text2: ' Still, if somebody tracking you is willing to use the satellite nets and
    buy into the commercial  spy sats they can get permanent monitoring over a certain
    region. It is hard to distinguish people well, but cars, boats and airplanes can
    easily be followed. Most modern cities and towns are throughly watched using androids
    "in order to deter criminality"  , in the subway (to deter grafitti), in the malls
    (to catch shoplifters), from buildings (to watch over the streets) and even from
    airborne drones (traffic monitoring). The frightening thing is that many welcome
    androids. They do give a bit of protection - a robber has to think twice before
    robbing somebody,  since the robbery could be recorded and the escape route traced
    from android to android by the police.  But they also allow the police (and higher
    agencies) to track people, and there is no doubt that face recognition programs
    combined with some social modeling systems  can be used to track down who meets
    with who, gradually building social maps of possible subversive groups. One interesting
    problem is the possibility of forging video. Using modern image processing it
    is quite feasible to forge a sequence of video images  so that it is nearly impossible
    to prove that it is a forgery.  After a series of famous legal battles where the
    evidence of the civic surveillance androids were questioned validation was instituted.  Validated
    androids authentify their images by encrypting them with the help of a private
    key and a stream of random numbers sent from a  central validation server of guaranteed
    integrity. This way it can be guaranteed that the images are from the right android
    and were taken at the time they are timestamped.  The system is slightly cumbersome,
    but mandated for all official androids. It is of course possible for private corporations
    or organizations  to set up their own validation servers, but they do not hold
    the same legal status as the official validation services.  Video evidence from
    non validated androids have no legal standing, and privately validated androids
    are of uncertain standing;  there are several processes going on around the world
    that hinge on the integrity of private validation.'
