  headline: Anti-Tech Protests aren't new.
  text1: "For the people that loved Robocorp new androids and its features,  it's
    probably going to come as disappointing news that the giant is making preparations
    to discontinue their new model.  The model is scheduled to be shut down and Robocorp
    encourages buyers to seek out the features in other Robocorp products. Meanwhile
    The situation in Bedrock has gone from bad to worse.  Robocorp\u2019s corporate
    buses are being vandalized by protestors upset with Stephen Lawrence murder.  Last
    week, a Robocorp engineer was personally vilified by fliers left around his home
    saying,  \u201CYou are building an unconscionable world of surveillance, control
    and automation. He is also your neighbour.\u201D  The activists objected to Robocorp's
    role in creating military androids, so they followed him to his home to publicly
    try to shame him."
  text2: "The Luddite movement in the early 1800s was history\u2019s most famous display
    of people organizing to prove how essential the human workforce is to the economy.
    \ Working class Englishmen, during a a seemingly endless war on Napolean\u2019s
    France and rampant low wages, lashed out at the Industrial Revolution\u2019s textile
    machinery.  The men saw machines as a threat to their employment as they were
    gradually phased out and replaced by technology. So they met at night secretly,
    \ sent death threats to magistrates, attacked the British army, and assailed the
    machines. Luddites didn\u2019t attack the foundations of emerging industry,  but
    rather wanted high-quality machines run by well-paid, properly trained workers.
    Still, society was fearful in early 1800s England that machines were jeopardizing
    their livelihoods as they knew them,  a sentiment that sounds familiar today.
    Back then, machines were attacked. "
