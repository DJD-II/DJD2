  headline: Scientist Killed at his home.
  text1: "Protests in Bedrock have affected everything.  But as the global consequences
    of almost a month of unprecedented unrest continue to be felt, the story that
    started it all has turned the world into chaos.  A month ago, a Robocorp Ltd Scientist,
    Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a brutal attack in district 5 of Bedrock city.
    The Metropolitan Police bungled the investigation into his killers.  The Inquiry
    which followed by Sir William Macpherson produced one of the most damning documents
    ever to emerge from the heart of the Bedrock police establishment.  Most famously,
    he concluded the force was \u201Cinstitutionally racist\u201D against androids
    issuing wide ranging recommendations for reform.   barrister and broadcaster Hashi
    Mohamed, examines what\u2019s changed since the MacPherson report was published.
    The inquiry examined the bungled police investigation of the murder of the Scientist
    Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in a brutal attack in district 5."
  text2: 'No fingerprints lead the police to think it was an andoird that stabbed
    Stephen Lawrence a month ago in his appartement in district 5. The investigators
    who arrived saw the victim lying in his living room stabbed in his chest several
    times.  Naturally, murder is always rather dreadful, but all the same. Everyone
    who might possibly have been involved in this crime was a perfect stranger to
    Stephen Lawrence. Says John Louis head of police force investigating this crime
    : "So although we are sorry that he is dead more importantly we are detectives
    on the case,  With a puzzle to solve and a murderer to bring to justice. And we
    will succeed.".  The surveillance camera footage, provided by the bedrock police
    force, shows an android with plate "XS-301234" entering the building where the
    vitcim was killed that day. Everyone is now chasing this android and asks for
    anyone who sees him to inform the police of his whereabouts.'
